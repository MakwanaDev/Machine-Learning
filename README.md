# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Projects Repository**. This repository contains a collection of various machine learning projects, showcasing the application of different machine learning algorithms including regression, classification, and clustering. Each project is designed to tackle a unique problem, providing insights and solutions through data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Project List

- **Airbnb Listings Price Prediction**
- **Airline Satisfaction**
- **Credit Card Default Classification**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Electricity Demand Clustering**
- **Flight Fare Prediction**
- **Insurance Prediction**
- **Loan Applicant Risk**
- **Melbourne Housing Price**
- **Regression - California House Pricing**
- **TTC Bus Delay Data Analysis**
- **Telecom Churn Prediction**
- **Topic Modeling with Tweets**

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The projects in this repository leverage various **machine learning algorithms** to perform tasks such as:

- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., housing prices, flight fares)
- **Classification**: Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., credit card default, airline satisfaction)
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., electricity demand patterns)

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are extensively used across the projects:

- **Sklearn**: Used for implementing machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computations and handling arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Based on Matplotlib, used for statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: An interactive graphing library making it easy to create complex visualizations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Each project includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to gain a better understanding of the data. EDA techniques involve:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
- **Data Visualization**: Using histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and more to uncover patterns and relationships.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.
